Paper 1 (Hybrid recommendation system)

The Hybrid recommendation model is divided into seven types: Weighted Hybridization, Switching Hybridization, Cascade Hybridization, Mixed Hybridization, Feature-Combination, Feature-Augmentation, and Meta-level, according to the method that combines filtering techniques in Burks’ study [[44](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/11/1/141#B44-electronics-11-00141)]. [Table 1](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/11/1/141#table_body_display_electronics-11-00141-t001) is a table summarizing the seven methods of the Hybrid recommendation model introduced in Burks’ study [[44](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/11/1/141#B44-electronics-11-00141)].

Paper 2 (College Library Personalized Recommendation System Based on Hybrid
Recommendation Algorithm)

Hybrid approaches has three strategies. The first is by
making content-based and collaborative filtering separately
and then combining them. The second is by adding contentbased capabilities to a collaborative filtering approach (and
vice versa).The third is by unifying the approaches into one
model [5]. In order to compare the performance of the two
algorithms and the hybrid algorithm, the first strategies is
adopted in this paper.

3.1. Collaborative filtering algorithm based on university
users
User based collaborative filtering algorithm is divided into
three steps, the establishment of user model, find the nearest
neighbor set and generate recommendations. [6,7]

3.3. Content based recommendation algorithm
Content-based filtering methods are based on a description
of the book and a profile of the user’s preference.[9] This
algorithm try to recommend books that are similar to those
that a user liked in the past.

Hybrid approaches, making content-based and
collaborative-based predictions separately and combining
them could be more effective in books recommender systems.
The architecture of recommender systems shown in Fig. 2.

### Key Concepts of Content-Based Recommendation:

1. **Item Representation** : Each item is represented by a set of features or attributes. For example, in a movie recommendation system, features might include the genre, director, actors, or keywords describing the plot.
2. **User Profile** : The system builds a profile for each user based on the features of the items they have previously liked or interacted with. The user profile reflects the user's preferences for certain item features.
3. **Similarity Measure** : The system compares the features of new items to the user profile to calculate the similarity. Common measures include cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or more advanced techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for text-based features.
4. **Recommendation Generation** : The system recommends items that are most similar to the user's profile. For example, if a user frequently watches and rates highly action movies, the system will recommend other action movies with similar features.


 **Collaborative Filtering** :

* **User-Based Collaborative Filtering** : Recommends items to a user based on the preferences of similar users. It finds users who have similar tastes and suggests items those users liked.
* **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering** : Recommends items that are similar to items the user has previously liked. It compares items based on user ratings and finds items that are often rated together by the same users.
